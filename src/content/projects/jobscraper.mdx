**Project description:** Personal python automation app from July 2025 which I built to automate my daily routine of checking new job applications on different job boards.

**Why?**<br/>
Default search/filters on LinkedIn/Glassdoor suck.
You always get some **unrelevant results** like 'DevOps Engineer' for 'Frontend Developer' search, need to use **multiple listings** like 'Fullstack Developer' vs 'Fullstack Engineer' manually checking **duplicates**, **cant filter** out unwanted companies or terms.

See **[JobData](/portfolio/projects/jobdata)** for some job data analysis based on the scraped data.

## Highlights

- parallel scraping of multiple job board feed urls (currently only LinkedIn & Glassdoor support)
- automated LinkedIn login and scroll (saves and reuses browser_profile)
- custom filters for company,title search term,rating and salary blacklisting
- persist individual job status/comment fields
- persist all jobs (old jobs get archived)
- grouping by company name (historical data)
- auto-highlight and auto-open new jobs without filters
- already applied filtering
- export to Google Sheet or CSV
