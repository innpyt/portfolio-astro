## Accomplishments

- **Infrastructure:** Identified architectural degradation in CI/CD pipelines, which should save about 3-12 minutes on each job and result in significantly higher build speed and reliability
- **Architecture:** Identified architectural inefficiencies in a 5-repo structure and pushed a transition to a unified **Turborepo** setup, potentially cutting CI/CD overhead by another 60%, streamlining cross-project development and drastically improving developer experience
- **Performance:** Spearheaded the optimization of listing pages, resolving critical memory leaks and redundant
re-rendering patterns. Optimized data-fetching strategies to reduce server load by 15% and
significantly decrease Time to Interactive (TTI).
